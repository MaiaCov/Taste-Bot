# Taste-Bot
We first need to create a chatbot that can receive messages, in this case, communicate with the user. 
Then we are probably going to connect the bot to the web, create a web app, working for all operating systems. The bot should scan the input and run it through an algorithm to see if some words are compatible with our database. If that's the case, perfect, the bot will calculate the best drink or food for the user and then is going to give an output to the user with some recommendation. 
The user can continue to give input and talk with the bot and the output should always be smart and give answers with some logic. 
We need to create an interface in the future to make a better experience with the use of our chatbot. 
When all the basics are done, we can start implementing other functions, like food, drink, or nightclubs. The user can talk to the bot frequently, but the chatbot is for fast use and helpful one, with accurate responses and giving the user a great use of his time.

You already download it the folder, nice! If you are in VScode, open the folder, the terminal, with the path to the folder, and then type this in to the terminal:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process**

**.\env\Scripts\activate**

**pip install flask**

**pip install -r requirements.txt**

**python .\main.py**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

And with all of that, if everything is correct, it should be running!
